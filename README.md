# Active Forest Fire Detection using GK-2A
Active forest fire detection is crucial for the people, air quality, ecological impact, environmental impact and property safety etc. This repository contains code that was made for a group project at UNIST for the course UEE354 Disaster Monitoring Using AI in Fall 2023. The objective of the group project was (i) To develop machine learning and deep learning-based model to detect near real-time forest fire more accurately using contextual information ansd (ii) To monitor the feasibility of high temporal forest fire detection using GK-2A AMI Satellite. Data preprocessing for 2D CNN, Final 1D CNN model and Feature selection was done by S. M. Sohel Rana. Random forest model was done by Sejeong Bae, and final feature selection was done by Da-hee Lee. 2D CNN model showed poor performance but Random Forest and 1D CNN showed performance more than 90% accuracy. Dataset Extraction file was used from the Mentor Taejun Sung in Matlab. This repository contains code that was made by S. M. Sohel Rana.
