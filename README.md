# Active-Forest-Fire-Detection-using-GK-2A
Active forest fire detection is crucial for the people, air quality, ecological impact, environmental impact and property safety etc. This repository contains code that was made for a group project at UNIST for the course UEE354 Disaster Monitoring Using AI in Fall 2023. Data preprocessing for 2D CNN and Feature selection was done by Sohel. Random forest model was done by Sejeong, and final feature selection was done by Da-hee.2D CNN model showed poor performance but Random Forest and 1D CNN showed performance more than 90% accuracy. Dataset Extraction file was used from the Mentor Taejun in Matlab.
